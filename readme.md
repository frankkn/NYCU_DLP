# Deep Learning and Practice

Course labs for 535500/535501 of NYCU.
(2023 Summer NYCU Deep learning and pracice)

## Notice 
If you want to run each code, please open .ipynb or .py file in each Lab folder.

## Lab1: Back propagation
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.

## Lab2: EEG classification
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, you need to try different kinds of activation function including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU.

## Lab3: Leukemia classification
Implement ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet152 architecture to analyze accurate lymphoblastic leukemia (急性淋巴性白血病).

## Lab4: Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.

## Lab5: Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
Implement two deep reinforcement algorithms by completing the following three tasks:  
(1) Solve LunarLander-v2 using deep Q-network (DQN)  
(2) Solve LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)  
(3) Solve BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 using deep Q-network (DQN)  

## Lab6: Let's play DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)
Implement a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate synthetic images according to multi-label conditions.

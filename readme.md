# Deep Learning and Practice

Course labs for 535500/535501 of NYCU.
(2023 Summer NYCU Deep learning and pracice)

## Notice 
If you want to run each code, please open .ipynb file in each Lab folder.

## Lab1: Back propagation
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.

## Lab2: EEG classification
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, you need to try different kinds of activation function including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU.

## Lab3: Leukemia classification
Implement ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet152 architecture to analyze acute lymphoblastic leukemia (急性淋巴性白血病).
Write your own custom DataLoader and design your own data preprocessing technique through PyTorch framework.
Upload your prediction result to the Kaggle competition and plot the confusion matrix and the accuracy curve to evaluate the performance.

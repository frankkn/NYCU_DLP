# Deep Learning and Practice

Course labs for 535500/535501 of NYCU.
(2023 Summer NYCU Deep learning and pracice)

## Notice 
If you want to run each code, please open .ipynb file in each Lab folder.

## Lab1: Back propagation
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.

## Lab2: EEG classification
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, you need to try different kinds of activation function including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU.

## Lab3: Leukemia classification
Implement ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet152 architecture to analyze accurate lymphoblastic leukemia (急性淋巴性白血病).

## Lab4: Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.

# Lab4: Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.
Highly correlated to the ICCV paper below:
1. “Everybody Dance Now” (makes the prediction in a GAN-based model)
2. “Stochastic Video Generation with a Learned Prior” (makes the video prediction in the VAE-based model)

## Demo questions:
1. What is the KL divergence ?
2. How do you calculate your loss ?
3. What is the teacher forcing strategy ?
4. Explain three paramters of Decoder fusion.
5. Which one is the generative model? VAE, AE, decoder fusion. (All)
6. Explain the differences between AE and VAE.

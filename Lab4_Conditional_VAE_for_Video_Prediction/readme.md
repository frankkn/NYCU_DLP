# Lab4: Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.
Highly correlated to the ICCV paper below:
1. “Everybody Dance Now” (makes the prediction in a GAN-based model)
2. “Stochastic Video Generation with a Learned Prior” (makes the video prediction in the VAE-based model)

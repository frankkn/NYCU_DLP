# Lab3: Leukemia classification
Implement ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet152 architecture to analyze acute lymphoblastic leukemia (急性淋巴性白血病).
* Write your own custom DataLoader and design your own data preprocessing technique through PyTorch framework.
* Upload your prediction result to the Kaggle competition
* Plot the confusion matrix and the accuracy curve to evaluate the performance.

## Demo questions:
1. Explain how do you implement ResNet
2. How ResNet solve gradient vanishing problem
3. Explain why ResNet can handle input of different size (A: By average pool)
